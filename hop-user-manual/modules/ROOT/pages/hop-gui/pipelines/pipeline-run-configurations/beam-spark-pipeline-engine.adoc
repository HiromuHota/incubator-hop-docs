= Apache Beam Spark Pipeline Engine

== Beam Spark

The Apache Spark Runner can be used to execute Beam pipelines using Apache Spark.

The Spark Runner executes Beam pipelines on top of Apache Spark, providing:

* Batch and streaming (and combined) pipelines.
* The same fault-tolerance guarantees as provided by RDDs and DStreams.
* The same security features Spark provides.
* Built-in metrics reporting using Spark’s metrics system, which reports Beam Aggregators as well.
* Native support for Beam side-inputs via spark’s Broadcast variables
