RAP is multi user framework by its nature. Every user session is
associated with a display. In RAP, Display#getDefault() will not create
a new display when it's called from non-UI thread - read
Display#getDefault JavaDoc. When you execute a code in a background
thread, RAP needs to know for which UI session (display) it belongs.
That's why you have to provide the correct UISession/display from outside.
